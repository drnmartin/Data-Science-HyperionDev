# Task 2: The String Data Type

There are two programmes within this task. The first programme (string_strip) simply demonstrates the use of the strip string manipulation method. The $ symbol is stripped from the string.

```
$$$Superman$$$

Superman
```

The second programme (string_manipulations) first strips ! from the sentence, then it capitalises the resulting sentence and finally it reverses the sentence.

```
The original phrase is: The!quick!brown!fox!jumps!over!the!lazy!dog!.

The original phrase with the exclamation marks removed is: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy 
dog .

The original cleaned phrase fully capitalised is: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG .    

The original cleaned phrase reversed is: . god yzal eht revo spmuj xof nworb kciuq ehT
