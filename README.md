# My Data Science Projects from my HyperionDev course.

These are my completed assignments from the training course. There were 25 tasks in total, some of which were not coding tasks. Only the coding tasks have been added to GitHub.
The majority of the tasks were in Python and some later tasks are in Jupyter Notebook. Some tasks require data files in the
form of either .txt or .csv. These data files are included in the folders so that the programmes can execute.
